# Python-Deep-Transfer-Learning-Art-generating
The orignal work of style transfering with deep learning by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is of Gatys et al (2015). There are, to my knowledge, two versions of implementation running outside. The first is from TensorFlow Tutorial, and the second is from Coursera. (For the second version, acknowledgement to access is to Mr. Kruitbosch for the Eurostat ESTP course.). The second version, making use of functions from MatConvNet Team, is more concise. However, it is not so intuitive and more difficult to implement. In this application, attempt is made to combine these two implementations.
